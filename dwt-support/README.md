## Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge all the [contributors](https://http://www.dsource.org/projects/dwt/wiki/Contributors) to the [d-widget-toolkit](https://www.github.com/d-widget-toolkit/dwt) project.

Here is a big **THANK YOU** for all your time and effort!

## Objectives
 1. Help for new D programmers and hobbyists
 2. Make it more fun and enjoyable to learn D with DWT GUI apps
 3. Advance the use of the D language

## Hello World
A hello_dwt.d file is included as an example.

Use build_DUB, build_DMD, or simply use dub with no arguments to compile.

The dub.json files use either your custom resource file, or the DWT default.
