##Std Process Demo

###Objectives

 1. Help for new D programmers and hobbyists
 2. Make it more fun and enjoyable to learn D with DWT GUI apps
 3. Advance the use of the D language

###Overview

I like to write small utilites and tools from time to time.  I have used AutoIt in the past, but now I am moving to D.  One of the key tools I use is a GUI wrapper over some Windows executable.  The std.process functions are perfect for this purpose!
 
This is a demo of some of the std.process functions.

It is written in modular form so each function can be reused in your code.
