Oddities

DMD v2.074.0 has an issue writing *.di files
The workaround is to import the *.d files instead

Several *.d files have double semicolons ";;" that give DUB warnings

Linux libs must be in the following order, dwt-base last.
you "should" be able to revers the order, but it just hangs.
Don't know why?

    "-l:org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86.a" \
    "-l:dwt-base.a" \
